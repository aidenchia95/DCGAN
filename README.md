# DCGAN
Training my first DCGAN with Keras  
Achieved a decent result, but training the model does take quite some time despite running on NVIDIA 1070 GPU.  
Drew major inspiration from yashk2810's implementation: https://github.com/yashk2810/DCGAN-Keras  

Here are some of the better results:

# Future Work
1. Expanding beyond MNIST
2. Finding a way to quantitatively assess the performance of the Generator
